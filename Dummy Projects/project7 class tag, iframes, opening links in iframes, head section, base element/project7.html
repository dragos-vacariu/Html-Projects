		<h1>Absolute filepath for an image: <'img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain"></h1>
		<h1> Relative filepath for an image: <'img src="./images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain"> </h1>
		 <p>
		 An absolute filepath is the full URL to an internet file or a local file, whereas a relative filepath points to a 
		 file relatively placed to the current location in the directory or on the web. 
		 </br></br>It is a best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).
		When using relative filepaths, web pages will not be bound to your current base URL. All links will work on your 
		own computer (localhost) as well as on your current public domain and your future public domains.

		<h4>According to the HTML5 standard; the <'html>, the <'body>, and the <'head> tag can be omitted.</h4>
		<h4>The head section of html document should contain only the following components: <'title>, <'meta> tags 
		<'link> example:  <'link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">,  <'script> <br></br>For javascripts (the best place for a 
		script to be is before the closing section of the body <\body>), but it can also be putted in the head section.
		the <'base> element: you can see an example in the head section of this document. The base element defines a default 
		address or a default target for all links on a page</h4>
