	<head> <script> //THIS IS A SINGLE LINE JAVASCRIPT COMMENT
/*THIS IS A MULTILINE JAVASCRIPT COMMENT

	I will use this synthax for making comments
	The head section of a html file can contain the title of the webpage or any other descriptive stuff, which have
	the purpose of helping the user find the page.
	So let's set the title of the page:*/
		</script>  <!-- This is an html comment. The <script> tag is used to create javascript code. -->
	<title>Project 1</title>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
		<script>//meta charset is an descriptive element for the page. containing the encoding type. </script>
	<meta name="author" content="Dragos Vacariu">
		<script>//this is an descriptive element for the page. containing the author's name. </script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script>
		//The body contains all the informations enclosed in the webpage: images, texts, audio, video contents etc.
		</script>

		<script>//Loading an image</script>
		<img src="asciifull.jpg" alt="My test image"> <script>//alt attribute is a descriptive attribute that the image has
		//it won't be seen by the user unless they use special tools to get it, or an error that causes the image fail to load
		//the alt keyword should always provide information about the content of the image.</script>

		<script>//Headings: there are 6 headings that can be displayed in html from <h1> to <h6></script>
		<h6>This is the sixth heading.</h6>
		<h1>This is the first heading.</h1>

		<script>//Paragraphs are used each time when working with text, to help you arrange the text into the page.</script>
		<p>This is a text paragraph.</p>

		<script>//Lists, a webpage can contain lists in order to arrange the text in the page. There are 2 types of lists
		//1. Unordered Lists having the tag <ul>	<li>element 1</li><li>element 2</li>		</ul>
		//2. Ordered Lists having the tag <ol>		<li>element 1</li><li>element 2</li>		</ol>
		</script>
		<ul>
			<li>first row - unordered list</li>
			<li>second row - unordered list </li>
		</ul>

		<ol>
			<li>first row - ordered list</li>
			<li>second row - ordered list </li>
		</ol>

		<script>//Links are very important elements on a webpage. Examples below:</script>
		<a>This is the first link.</a> </br>
		<a href = "http://deady.dk-one.com">This is the second link.</a>
		<p>Using <em>italic</em> <!-- INSTEAD OF <em> tag, the <i> tag can also be used, dispite that is old and obsolete -->
		<b> bold</b><u> undelined</u> text.</p>
