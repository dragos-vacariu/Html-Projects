		<pre>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
		CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
		CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
		CSS can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways:
		<ol>
		<li><b>Inline</b> - by using the style attribute in HTML elements</li>
		<li><b>Internal</b> - by using a <'style> element in the <'head> section</li>
		<li><b>External</b> - by using an external CSS file</li>
		<ol>
		 Inline CSS looks like this <'h1 style="color:blue;">Blue color text in here.</'h1> Inline CSS was used for this 
		 pharagraph to set the text color green.
		 
		Internal CSS sinthax looks like this:
		<'head>
		body {background-color: powderblue;}
		h1   {color: blue;}
		p    {color: red;}
		<\head>
		Internal CSS was used to make the background of this page green.

		External CSS sinthax looks like this:
		<'head>
		  <'link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
		<\head>
		External CSS was used to make the heading 1 <'h1> texts red.
		 </pre>
